"In the stillness of the night,
Where shadows dance in the moonlight,
A whisper in the wind,
A melody from within.

Soft and gentle, a lullaby,
Soothing the soul, reaching high,
Into the depths of longing hearts,
Where dreams and desires depart.

Oh, how sweet the sound
Of words that rise, unbound
A symphony of emotion
A timeless devotion.

So let the words flow like a river
Carrying us away, forever
In the beauty of poetic grace
A masterpiece in this sacred space."
